# Reset Form Field [Action]

The **Reset Form Field** action allows you to reset values in form widgets. This is especially useful for clearing previously entered data and giving users a clean slate.

For example, after a form is successfully submitted, you can use this action to clear the input fieldsâ€”making it easy for users to enter new information for another submission.
